## Project Description
Elden Ring "Wiki" is an application that acts as a database for Elden Ring, a popular video game. The application allows users to see every single resource in the game such as inventory items, locations, bosses, etc. to find out more information about that resource.

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

MongoDB or and Mongo DB Atlas repository must be configured, and an API key must be obtained for the National Parks API (this is free).

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sean3434/elden-ring-react.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies
```sh
   npm i
   ```
   
   ## Usage
   The website does not require any additional resources or sign-up. Simply navigate through the site through the home page or by clicking on a directory in the navigation bar and find the in-game resource you are looking for. All items, talismans, ammo types, armor, shields, weapons, ahes of war, incantations, sorceries, spirits, bosses, creatures, locations, and NPC's in the entire game can be found within the site.

   ### MVP Goals
* As a user, I want to be able to click on any category in the nav bar to navigate to that section.
* As a user, I want to be able to see every resource in the entire game for each section.

### Stretch Goals
* As a user, I want to be able to search for any resource using a search bar.
* As a user, I want to be able to click on each resource to see all of its info on its own page (show page).
* As a user, I want to be able to implement react paginate to separate some of the pages that have 100+ items.
